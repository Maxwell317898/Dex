This script should be used in coordination with other DeX solutions.
While this system is very good at stoping common exploits, it may not pick up on all exploits.

This script can send reports from clients to a webhook to be aknowledged by a game developer.
That one of there scrips is being moved etc, to enable this feature, change the UseWebhook variable to true
and set the webhookURL variable to the URL of your webhook.
