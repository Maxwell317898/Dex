>legacy version 1 is still available but will no longer recive support.

Deactivating eXploiters </br>
Server side anti-cheat

> This Branch is on version 2 to see latest versions check out other `branches` </br>
## How does it work?

It works by checking if a player is moving at the right speed and traveling the right distance if they teleport it will notice thay have moved to fast and kick them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DeX has not been tested as of yet by any exploit methods. Once tested, results will be posted.

## What I am working on.
Client side detection (that works this time) </br>
ban procedure (to ban exploiters) `this one may take some time, as Client side detection is being worked on`

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> [!CAUTION]
> This measure of protection against exploitation comes with no warrenty, or 100% certenty of removing exploiters
